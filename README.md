## ðŸ¦¾ Challenge

Create an application to practice what has been learned in React Native!

Now we will develop an application that will store portfolio repositories using the Node.js backend was done in the first challenge. The app must be able to:

* <b>List your API repositories</b>: You should be able to create a list of all the repositories that are registered in your API with fields: title, techs and number of likes, following the $ {repository.likes} likes pattern, just changing the number to be dynamic.

* <b>Like a listed API repository</b>: You should be able to like an item in your API using a button with "Like" text and must update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile.

Light camera action!
